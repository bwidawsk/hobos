conventions:
In general what style you use is up to you so long as it is similar to the rest
of the code.

However, an ever expanding list of things which are generally a good practice:

Don't attempt to outsmart the compiler. 
Some examples:
Don't use shifts to divide or multiply.
	i = x >> 3, instead should be i = x / 8;
Avoid the inline keyword
Avoid compiler specific extensions as much as possible

Avoid naming any symbol with more than 3 words.
	int my_variable_name_sucks;
