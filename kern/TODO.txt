TODOs (aside from the ones in code)

Refactors

1 - Remove use of direct calls to early_printf. It should be implicit to console functions.
3* - page allocator that allows freeing memory
	Not needed until there is repeated use of malloc
3 - Heap based malloc
5 - I took kvprintf from freebsd, I should write my own

Build
2 - Clean up makefiles dependency stuff. It seems to be broken when you move around header files.
	need a way to reproduce the problem
5 - Move .d files to a temporary directory
5* - Some kind of menuconfig

New
1* - Actually implement KASSERT
	It's important to get this right before too much code goes in
1 - Some basic libc functionality
	This task is started and will be added to as needed,
	bcopy is a big one i need to do next
2 - Timer interrupt
	good test for me, plus this will get basic interrupt handling working
2 - HW query
2 - hard disk driver
2 - more mm functionality:
	Ability to map any PA to any VA (seems useful right now)
3 - Do something with kernel command line, unit test?
4 - equivalent of freebsd hints (pulls from compile time/command line)
4 - Get things to work with GRUB or FreeBSD bootloader
